                    You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. The more we do this - the more it
                    will do good things to our heart. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun.
                    Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Don't fight it, use what happens. Let's have a happy little
                    tree
                    in here. Just beat the devil out of it. Learn when to stop.

                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p class="text-section">
                    Let your heart be your guide. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.
                    That's a
                    son of a gun of a cloud. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Just make
                    little strokes like that.

                    This is the way you take out your flustrations. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't
                    have
                    any other kind. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. There are no limits in
                    this
                    world.

                    If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.
                    I
                    like to beat the brush. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.
                    Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.

                <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
                <p class="text-section">
                    This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Fluff that up. It's hard to see
                    things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. We start with a vision in our heart, and we
                    put
                    it on canvas.
                    And maybe a little bush lives there. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Just let
                    these leaves jump off the brush Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Use
                    absolutely
                    no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.
                    Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Very easy to work these to death.<br>
                    <br>
                    We'll make some happy little bushes here. The least little bit can do so much. This is a happy
                    place,
                    little squirrels live here and play. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our
                    imagination.
                    We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Just let this happen. We just let this
                    flow right out of our minds. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona
                    Lisa' with a two-inch brush. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and
                    get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. All those
                    little son of a guns. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to
                    do
                    things.

                        A dream of Spring. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. The North remembers. The bear and the maiden
                        fair. Pay the iron price. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead
                        Lannisters. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. The
                        bear and the maiden fair.
