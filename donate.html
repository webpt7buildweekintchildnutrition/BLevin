                    We've entered the Alderaan system. Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding
                    Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board. Charming to the last. You
                    don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life! I surprised you had the
                    courage to take the responsibility yourself! Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you
                    to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will
                    dare oppose the Emperor now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip
                    through your fingers.

                    He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt
                    it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the
                    power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend,
                    are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention
                    block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!

                        We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers!
                        We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when
                        you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the
                        right
                        side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals.
                        Enemy fighters coming your way.

                        Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a Rebel base, but they
                        estimate that it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of
                        the
                        surrounding systems. She lied! She lied to us! I told you she would never consciously betray the
                        Rebellion. Terminate her...immediately!

                        The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to... No time to discuss this as a
                        committee. I am not a committee! You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid
                        field... Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off! Look! I see it, I see it. We're doomed! The
                        cave is collapsing. This is no cave. What?

                        The security codes has been changed! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security
                        system. Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes control of the city. I advise
                        everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive. This way. Don't blame me. I'm an
                        interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you
                        talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just
                        open the door, you stupid lump.

                        Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. He told me enough! He told me you
                        killed him. No. I am your father. No. No. That's not true! That's impossible! Search your
                        feelings.
                        You
                        know it to be true. No! No! No! Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is
                        your
                        destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It's the only way
